## Description

My project is website built for my wife's christian workout/community group.

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .navbar .navbar-brand - these classes are used to set the font color and size in the navigation bar.

2. .jumbotron - this class is used to set a background image and its size to my bootstrap jumbotron.

3. .cross - this class is used to set the size/margin of the image used in my H1 within the jumbotron.

4. .about - used to set the "About" section of my site to a flex container as well as change the flex direction for smaller/larger(in media query) screens.

5. .containerInstructors - used to set the "Instructors" section to a flex container and change the flex direction for smaller/larger screens.

6. .classes - used to set the "Classes" section to a flex container and change the flex direction for smaller/larger screens. Also used to set a margin on the "Classes" section.

7. .info - used to margins for the <p> portion of my "About" section.

8. .classPic - used to set height/width/margins for the picture in my "About" section.

9. .container - used to set the position of the instructor info to relative, so it pops up within the image on hover. Also used it to change opacity on the image and text box that appears on hover.

10. .image - commented out because it didn't seem to make a difference on the site.

11. .middle - used to set transition/opacity/position of the instructor info text box.

12. .text - used to set background color/text color/font size/padding on the instructors text box.

13. .dayButton - used to style the buttons for each day of the week that show class schedules, including a hover feature.

14. .footerCore - used to set background color of the footer

15. .footerText - used to set margin/padding for text in the footer.
```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. Using jQuery I set the day buttons to display information about any available classes on click using toggle option. Tried to get info to slide out when toggled but couldn't get it to work yet.
